With SCP protocol, you can specify the following command as custom shell on the SCP/Shell page of Advanced Site Settings dialog: sudo -s However you will not be able to provide a password for su (see remote command execution limitations). So you may be able to do the above only if you are allowed to do sudo su without being prompted with password.\nsource\n","permalink":"https://concosminx.github.io/hugo-blog/posts/first/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently, I had to upload some folders to a Linux server (Oracle Cloud), but the user permissions I had did not allow me to create the necessary folders.
