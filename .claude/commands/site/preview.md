I want to preview the current Hugo site locally. Please:

1. Stop any running Hugo server processes
2. Serve the site with draft content enabled: `hugo server -D`
3. Provide the local URL where I can view the site
4. If I'm working on a specific post ($ARGUMENTS), give me the direct URL to that post so I can click it

Format the URL as a clickable link for easy navigation.
