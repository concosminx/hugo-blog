Title: $ARGUMENTS
Description: A description for the post

Please:
1. Generate the proper kebab-case filename with today's date (YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md)
2. Create the file with Hugo's 'hugo new content' command
3. Update the front matter to include:
   - The title properly formatted
   - Today's date
   - draft: true
   - The description
   - Author: david-taylor
4. Show me the command to serve the site locally so I can preview it

Ensure all formatting follows UK English standards.
