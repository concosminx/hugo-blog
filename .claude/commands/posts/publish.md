I want to publish the blog post at $ARGUMENTS. Please:

1. Check that the post exists
2. Verify all links in the post are valid
3. Check UK English spelling and grammar
4. Update the front matter to set draft: false
5. Commit the changes with a descriptive message
6. Push the changes to the remote repository
7. Provide the URL where the post will be visible once the site rebuilds

Also run a final build test to ensure the site builds successfully with the published post.
